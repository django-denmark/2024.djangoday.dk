Djangonauts from in and around Denmark are meeting up for the fourth edition of
Django Day Copenhagen, to be held on **October 4th**. It will be a full day of talks,
either to be experienced **online -or- at our venue**.

Come and meet your local and excellent community and share with them.
[Tell us](/cfp/) about your idea and your contribution to make this a great day.

##### 📸 2024-10-07: Thanks for an amazing day!

We had a great time, and we want to say thanks to all speakers, sponsors, participants, the venue and our co-organizers.

**Videos will be uploaded this week**.

##### 🦉 2024-09-30: Tickets still for sale: Late bird and streaming (free)

You can still get tickets for streaming and "late bird" tickets (early bird gets the worm <=> late bird no worm => no food).

##### 🪩 2024-09-27: Remember to party!

Don't forget that after the event, we encourage everyone to find some dinner in the area and come back from 19:30. We'll have a bar open full of good beer and drinks.
If you cannot attend the event but want to join the party, please email info@django-denmark.org

##### 📣️ 2024-09-04: Program is ready

Thanks to all the speakers that submitted talks, we now have a full-day program!

<!--
##### 📣️ 2024-09-01: Program coming up...

The call for proposals has closed and we are announcing the final program shortly. At the same time, the "early bird" discount has also ended.

##### 📣️ 2024-06-10: Ticket sales open

Venue tickets can now be found! Both Corporate Support and Individual tickets are available. The latter has a time-limited early bird offer 🏃️.


##### 📣️ 2024-05-23: Getting ready for another Django Day Copenhagen

We've finally launched the website! We're eager to make this another great day,
and we would **love your help**. You can for instance [submit a talk](/cfp/), [help us out with the organizing](mailto:info@django-denmark.org), encourage others to submit talks, or convince your employer to get a corporate supporter ticket.

# Program

Django Day is a full day of talks, all connected to modern issues faced
by Django developers of all experiences. It's a single-track
event, meaning that you won't have to miss anything. The day will end
with a round of **lightning talks**, which can be submitted on the day of the event,
and be drawn during the day.
