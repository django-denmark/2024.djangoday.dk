Is marrying Django and FastAPI something you should do? Not unless you have a case for it. And there are specific cases. 

This talk starts by going through such case by describing the problem and approaches considered. And what led to this marriage.

As in any marriage, good communication and some compromise are required. I.e. care has to be taken for Django and FastAPI to work nicely together.

So we'll go into what we ended up putting in place. What works well and what could work better.

The suggested approach is by no means "the best" approach. However it's an approach that is embedded in a team's CI/CD flow. And as a result deployed to a production environment.

## About Joseph

I‚Äôm Joseph. I am in software engineering since the ‚Äò00s. Working professionally since ‚Äò06.

Most of the time my roles were ‚Äúbackend‚Äù. Where working with data and relational databases is a key part of backend.

From ‚Äò08 onwards I worked a lot with Python. And the framework I worked with most is Django.
