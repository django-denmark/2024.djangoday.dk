If you work in Django development, you most likely are a worker,
having nothing in common with the employing class. This is the case even
if you are highly paid and classified as a freelancer. The modern
economic system injures you just as it injures the rest of us.

Unfortunately, freelance Django developers are often underserved by
trade unions because of the arbitrary details of legal entity
structure and residence juristiction. Fortunately, there are other ways
to wield our power. I will present some approaches of relevance to the
Django community.
