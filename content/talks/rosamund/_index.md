I'll be introducing my side project [Named After Women](https://named-after-women.berlin/), built with Django, which documents the diverse stories of women who gave their names to the streets of Berlin: writers, artists, politicians, members of the resistance, and more. Currently, only 500-600 streets in Berlin are named after women (compared to some 3,000 named after male historical figures).

Not only will I go into the ways this project combines my humanities background with the tech career I started a few years ago, but I will also demonstrate how I'm using Django to build this API and store basic GIS data, consumed by the Leaflet.js library in order to create an interactive map within a React app.
