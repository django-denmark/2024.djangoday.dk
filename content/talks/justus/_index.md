Django is highly integrated framwork with batteries included. In development you have tasks that you need to run for testing, packaging, maintenance and deploy. Often these things are a hodgepodge of scripts, Makefiles, oneliners in Readme. What if we would go all the way with Django’s manage.py?

In this talk we go through how create, extend and replace existing management commands. We see how to use other programs from manage.py, setup proxy connections and integrate secrets.
