Django migrations are a great tool, but after years of changes in a project they can become very numerous, slowing down tests. Is it possible to optimize them?

Django migrations are a great tool for keeping track of changes you made to your models over time.
After years of changes in a project they can become very numerous and you may notice that it takes a long time to create the test database.


## About Denny

Hi there!

I'm a freelance fullstack developer working with Python/Django, JavaScript/Vue.js and a little bit of Go and Rust. I'm also an active public speaker and open source contributor. You can visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/dennybiasiolli) or the ["talks" section of my website](https://www.dennybiasiolli.com/#talks).

I'm also a bit of a trail runner, and I enjoy both coding and hitting the trails. When I'm not busy turning lines of code into beautiful and functional applications, you can find me running through the mountains and breathing in the fresh air.
Just remember: if you can't find me at my desk, I'm probably out for a run! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ
