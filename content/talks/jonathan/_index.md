In a research project in epidemiology the need to harmonize context data (geo data, weather, land usage, population, …) started with a few simple Python scripts, and lead to an open source Django application for reproducible data harmonizing and documenting metadata of data sources for scientific teams. The resulting app is called [Data Hub](https://datasnack.org/). This talk tells the story on how we *unchained* Django: integrated our data processing pipelines in Django, fought with the documentation to build, deploy and serve the app and --on top-- tried to make the system reusable and adaptable for use-cases from different domains.

## About Jonathan

A displaced Englishman living just outside Stockholm, Sweden - I came for work, stayed for love, and would like to leave for the winters. I'm part of the IT "old guard" that worked with "legacy" systems for years, and have come to Python and Django in the last 5 years and just wish I'd done it sooner.
