Discover how the Djangonaut Space program transformed my professional path from a junior developer to an active member of the Django community. I'll share my experiences, the challenges I faced, and the lessons I learned along the way.

During my journey, collaboration and support were the keys to my growth. I aim to encourage others to become new open source contributors and demonstrate how a positive environment can empower individuals to become active members of a community.


## About Raffaella

I'm Raffaella from Italy, and I'm a new Django contributor. I usually write the 'Updates to Django' in [Django News](https://django-news.com/), and I was also a coach for Django Girls. Recently, I was honored to become a member of the Django Software Foundation (DSF).

In my spare time, I enjoy watching TV series to improve my English ðŸŽ¥. I also consider myself a fiber artist. Iâ€™m particularly proud of my crochet hats for cats, and luckily, my cats are happy to wear them. I've got a special hat for every occasion. ðŸ§¶
